# liri-node-app

LIRI is similar to SIRI - it interprets and recognizes language. It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data. This Application allows the user to interact with the Spotify, Twitter, and OMDB APIs, as well as play a game of hangman, and make "purchases" from a mock online store all on the command line.

After downloading, run npm install to get the necessary dependencies. Create a .env file to hold your API keys, adding the required API keys in this format:

# Spotify API Keys
SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

# Twitter API Keys
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret

After setup, run the program by navigating to it in your comand line and enter "node server.js". From there a list of the possible commands will populate and you can play around with them as you please. Have fun!
